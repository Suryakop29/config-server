I have created below role -- use this role for testing your Gitlab CICD pieline cration and testing
CICD for INFRA IAM Role -- cicd_infra_iam_role = "arn:aws:iam::851725287825:role/inteldev-cicd-infra-svc-role-dev"
 
Objective
Refer to postgresql infra repo, it was deployed to DEV using this role
Create Gitlab CICD yml file for.... 
validate
plan
apply to "DEV" only
destroy from "DEV" only -- this should be overwride parameter that Developer need to conciously provide while kicking off pipeline MANNUALLY -- NO destroy on merge to "dev" branch or "main" branch
feature --> merge to --> develop branch --> trigger above pipeline, deploy till "DEV" and stop, no further deployment
Mannual "destroy" from develop branch till "DEV" env
develop --> merge to "main" --> trigger deploy to "DEV" --> this can continue to --> deploy to UAT on manual review and approval --> can continue to PROD on manual review and approval



Can you check
 
Do we need both below for our application architecture or we just need ALB in EKS cluster
 
This is Stand alone ALB that will be sitting outside EKS cluster -- DO we need this on top of what we will have ALB in EKS as below?
https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/alb/aws/latest
 
This is ALB that will be sitting inside EKS cluster -- This we definately need, we will also need some kind of routing for secondery IP address range that we have now.

Hi Barge, Abhimanyu,
I have created ECR registry in DEV AWS account, you can use it for your testing with Airflow + EKS
 
851725287825.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/inteldev-ecr-repository-dev



Hi Barge, Abhimanyu, with help of Chhablani, Nitin, 

set up AWS profile based authentication in your VDI, validate that it is working and than try below step
 
Below assumes that you have completed above pre-requisites and your AWS profile name is "dev" for Charter AWS DEV account and your docker image name is "my-docker-image"
 
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 --profile dev | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 851725287825.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/inteldev-ecr-docker-imagesitory-dev
 
# Build Docker image
docker build -t my-docker-image .
 
# Tag Docker image
docker tag my-docker-image:latest 123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/my-docker-image:latest
 
# Push Docker image to ECR
docker push 851725287825.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-docker-image:latest




for glue job execution, need to do outside of the vpc, 
he is going to connect postgres with connection details no need to provide any vpc related creds..
